## About

The Emoji Prediction LSTM project is designed to predict emojis for text input. It utilizes pre-trained GloVe word embeddings and a deep learning model to map text to appropriate emojis. The model is trained on a dataset containing text samples and their corresponding emojis.

## Features

- Text to Emoji Prediction
- Deep Learning Model (LSTM)
- Pre-trained Word Embeddings
- Training and Evaluation

## Demo

To see the model in action, you can run the following code:

```python
from emoji_predictor import predict_emoji

prompt = 'Machine learning is fascinating!'
predicted_emoji = predict_emoji(prompt)
print(f"Predicted Emoji: {predicted_emoji}")

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

~bash~

```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emoji-prediction-lstm.git
cd emoji-prediction-lstm````
Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Model
The core of this project is the LSTM-based deep learning model. The model is defined in emoji_predictor.py and uses pre-trained word embeddings for text representation.

# Training
You can train your own model by running the training script:


This will train the model on your dataset and save the trained model as model.pth.

Evaluation
To evaluate the model, use
```total_loss['val_loss'].append(loss.item())```
This script will provide information about the model's performance on a validation dataset.

# Saving and Loading Model
You can save and load the trained model using the following code:

python

import torch

Save the model
torch.save(lstmModel.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

# Load the model
loaded_model = LstmModel(input_size, hidden_size, num_classes, num_layers)
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
